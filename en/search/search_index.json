For over a decade, organizations such as Citizen Lab and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) have applied forensic science in consensual environments to uncover the use of surveillance technologies against at-risk individuals in civil society.</p> <p>In recent years, new initiatives have emerged seeking greater accountability for digital attacks. Organizations from the Global North\u2014such as Amnesty International, Access Now, Reporters Without Borders, among others\u2014have launched their own forensic labs. At the same time, labs in the global majority have also exposed abuses against civil society. Many of these labs come together in networks like CiviCERT or regional communities.</p> <p>We believe it is essential to encourage and support more organizations in integrating forensic science into their investigation and incident response efforts. At the same time, we understand that completing a forensic analysis that results in accountability actions requires a minimum level of operational maturity and technical capability. This repository seeks to collect, share, and promote this knowledge, especially among labs in the Global Majority, in order to build a solid and common foundation that fosters practical collaborations.</p> <p>It is important to note that theoretical and practical knowledge is just one of the many elements required to produce a solid technical analysis. In addition, it is necessary to establish a relationship of trust with affected individuals, implement strong procedures (such as those related to informed consent), understand risks, foster collaboration, and follow good operational security practices, among others.</p> <p>Developing these skills and capacities takes time and resources, which are often limited within civil society, specially in the global majority. This is why collaboration and working together are the best tactics to exchange knowledge and experiences. If you are a civil society organization and are interested in integrating forensic processes into your work\u2014or in investigating the possible use of surveillance technologies in your region\u2014you can contact us at seguridad@socialtic.org to discuss important considerations and identify the best way to strengthen your capacities.</p>","tags":["community","intro"]},{"location":"community/code-of-conduct.html","title":"Community on consensual forensics for the defense of human rights","text":"2025-07-152025-07-15 <p>This repository adopts the following Code of Conduct, based on the SocialTIC team\u2019s code of conduct.

Expert investigations are often carried out by police, military or judicial entities. Historically, a lot of the documentation and processes have been developed by these groups in contexts where there is no direct consent for the investigation </p> </li> <li> <p> Academic investigations</p> <p>Through academic investigations researchers look to develop new lines and techniques for research that create improvements in the methodologies and generate practical knowledge to advance the forensic science field. </p> </li> <li> <p> Private sector investigations</p> <p>Private sector investigations are led by internal teams or external consultants, and have the goal of identifying the origin and the scope of possible intrusions and security incidents affecting business or institutions.  </p> </li> <li> <p> Investigations to protect Human Rights Defenders (HRDs)</p> <p>In the context of protection to Human Rights Defenders, forensic investigations intend to generate, preserve and present evidence of digital security incidents affecting HRDs. The goal is to enable access to remediation and accountability mechanisms that reduce the attacker's impunity and expose perpetrators that violate fundamental rights. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Frequently, forensic investigations start when there is a detection of a possible security incident. Although forensic analysis and incident response pursue different goals, consolidating both processes results in a stronger incident handling and containment that is also capable of collecting and preserving important evidence. </p> <p>Incident response is focused in detecting and responding to security events and incidents. Through well defined response procedures, it is possible to minimize the impact and contain the consequences of incidents. For an effective response, it is also important to uncover the root cause of intrusions, so that the threat can be eradicated in a timely manner.  </p> <p>When incident response and forensic analysis are done separately, actions that are taken without adequate coordination can have an impact both and challenge both the response and the analysis. For example, managing an incident without considering the need to document and preserve evidence, can result in damage or destruction of files and artifacts required of the forensic investigation. In a similar way, focusing solely on the forensic analysis, might delay the contention of an incident, resulting in higher severity consequences and a longer resolution time. </p> <p>Therefore, it is ideal to combine both processes in what is often referred to as Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), so that the response considers best practices for the collection and preservation of evidence, and findings from the forensic research can be used to contain and, ultimately, prevent future incidents. </p> <pre><code>flowchart LR\n  A[Incident Response] --&gt; C[DFIR];\n  B[Digital Forensics] --&gt; C;</code></pre> <p>This guide and repository are focused on the forensic aspects of an investigation.

Due to its nature, digital evidence is fragile, since it can be altered or destroyed during the collection or analysis stages. This is why, no matter what framework or best practices you follow, you should always the following basic principles during the investigation cycle: </p> <ul> <li>Whenever possible, avoid directly manipulating or working on the collected evidence. Instead, use local copies that do not endanger the original evidence.   </li> <li>Documenting is a key aspect of any forensic investigation. Any action that you take, any discovery that you make, any tool that you use, any hypotheses or conclusions that you arrive at should be well documented. It is important that a peer can review and reproduce your findings independently, looking at the evidence and the documentation.   </li> <li>While it is not always possible to know what will happen in a given case, if you believe it might be possible that the evidence is used as part of a legal proceeding, familiarize yourself with the relevant legislation in the jurisdiction, including by consulting with a peer expert in legal matters. </li> </ul> <p>Most of the frameworks coincide in the following phases: identification, collection, preservation, analysis and presentation. Below we detail what happens during each of these phases. </p> <pre><code>graph LR\n  A[1- Identification] --&gt; B[2- Collection and acquisition];\n  B --&gt; C[3- Verification and preservation];\n  C --&gt; D[4- Analysis];\n  D --&gt; E[5- Presentation];</code></pre> 1- Identification2- Collection and acquisition3- Verification and preservation4- Analysis5- Presentation <p>During the identification phase, the analyst determines which devices, accounts or systems might contain relevant information for the investigation. Examples include mobile phones, computers, online accounts, storage media, among others. Ideally, to determine which evidence to collect, the analyst should engage in a conversation with the impacted person, to understand what happened, what actions have been taken and what evidence and artifacts might be available. </p> <p>Once you identify the devices and systems that might contain evidence, the forensic analyst determines the best way to retrieve such evidence. The prioritization and the exact procedure to be used depends on several factors, including the type of incident, whether support is happening remotely or on the ground, the volatility of the evidence and the amount of effort required for the extraction. Keep in mind the following: </p> <ul> <li>It is possible that the analyst identifies more sources of information that you have capacity to collect. For example, if you are investigating a potential spyware infection, relevant data might exist in the targeted device, the network equipment, devices from the ISP, online accounts, to name a few. You should prioritize the collection of evidence that, according to your experience, has the greater value and potential for the investigation, and requires a reasonable amount of effort to collect.   </li> <li>Due to its nature, some digital data useful for analysis is volatile, which means it can be altered or destroyed as time passes or when you interact or turn the device off. An example of volatile data would be the list of running processes on a device. In general, it is recommended to prioritize the extraction of volatile data over non-volatile data (like hard-drives and file systems).   </li> <li>Considering the above, the analyst can then make a decision on the best way to extract information from devices. For example, you can create a physical image, or bit-for-bit copy of a storage media, to duplicate the contents, including information that might still be present but whose pointers were removed. Alternatively, you can also create logical images, or copy of visible archives. You might also want to extract specific information, for example targeted log files. </li> </ul> <p>Once you extract information, it is important to document and verify the integrity of the collected data. The goal of the integrity verification is to demonstrate that the information that has been collected from the device has not been altered during the analysis.Verification and preservation are always important, but they are critical in case you pretend to use the evidence in legal proceedings. Normally, the verification involves the calculation of cryptographic hash functions at the time of extraction, that generate an unique value for or fingerprint of a given data, that can be compared and verified later in the process. </p> <p>The preservation of evidence is closely related with the concept of chain of custody, which is especially important when dealing with physical evidence like devices, hard drives, computers, etc. It requires the establishment of a paper trail that documents where, when and how evidence was collected, where it was stored and who had access to it. </p> <p>During this phase, the analyst uses specialized tools and manual review to study and analyze the evidence to establish hypotheses and derive conclusions about what might have occurred. Often, the analysis will face large amounts of data, therefore a manual analysis can be slow and challenging, especially if there is no clarity on what or where to look. Some forensic tools can facilitate this process, especially if there is access to indicators of compromise. During this phase, it is important to use consistent and reproducible procedures and methodologies that can be verified. Sometimes, it won't be possible to establish any conclusion from the existing information. </p> <p>During the last step, an analyst prepares and presents key conclusions derived from the analysis. How the results are presented depends on the goal of the analysis and the audience. For example, it is different to present results to a potential target seeking an understanding of whether their devices were compromised, than presenting results in a public report whose goal is to expose abuses and document findings. If the report is intended to be used in legal proceedings it is helpful to consider the local jurisdiction and what might make expert testimony admissible in court. </p>","tags":["explainer","intro"]},{"location":"explainers/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics.html#how-can-digital-forensics-be-applied-in-the-defense-of-human-rights","title":"How can digital forensics be applied in the defense of Human Rights?","text":"<p>Organizations and individuals that defend Human Rights, for the most part, do not have robust monitoring systems to generate timely alerts of potential threats against their devices or networks. Therefore, it is common that the detection of an incident happens when consequences are evident, for instance when a document is leaked or when they are locked out of their online accounts. Due to the limitation in resources, it is also uncommon for organizations to have digital security specialists among their team, which means many of the digital security tasks fall on internal technology or communication teams, assisted frequently by external specialized helplines or consultants. </p> <p>When an individual or an organization detects a potential incident, either through a suspicious behavior or through an alert (for example, apple threat notifications, the helpline or the digital security point of contact starts a process to investigate and triage the situation, to understand what happened, when it happened and what actions have been taken so far. From these initial steps, it is important that the incident handler, in addition to considering and assessing the wellbeing of the affected Human Rights Defender, incorporates digital forensic best practices to protect and collect evidence that could potentially be helpful for accountability purposes. </p> <p>As it was mentioned above, incident response and digital forensic processes are closely intertwined. It is during that initial response that the incident handler identifies which systems, devices or accounts might contain useful evidence for a forensic investigation. It\u2019s worth highlighting that in our context, forensic investigations should always be consensual, which implies that before collecting any data we should provide clear information about what the process entails and what the goal is, ideally through a written form. </p> <p>Figuring out exactly what to collect depends on several factors, including the willingness of the at-risk person to share information, the type of incident, the tools and resources available, the technical proficiency of the person doing the collection, among others. In some cases, the incident handler or point of contact can do an initial triage and collection, and work in collaboration with trusted third parties to further examine the data and identify signs and indicators of compromise. While deep technical proficiency is not required to do the collection of evidence and artifacts, it is important that whoever is doing the collection understands key concepts and considerations like the ones included in this resource. </p> <p>For example, in some instances it is counterproductive to turn off and ship a device to a 3rd party forensic laboratory for analysis. This would likely destroy useful volatile evidence \u2013data that is altered or destroyed when manipulating or shutting off a device. If we want to collect this type of data, it is more convenient to use forensic tools that allow a live collection that includes information like running processes, temporary files, etc. </p> <p>Buenas Pr\u00e1cticas</p> <p>Throughout this forensic process, one of the most important aspects is keeping a good chronological documentation of actions taken, evidence collected, hashes, tools used, issues faced, consent, etc. </p> <p>In most cases, evidence can not be deeply analyzed on site, and additional forensic tools, manual analysis and research are necessary to establish conclusions about what might have occurred. This offsite analysis is often conducted by analysts with deeper knowledge and understanding of the operating systems in question, and also have access to tools, indicators and methodologies for analysis. </p> <p>It is possible that the initial analysis does not provide any immediate result or match with known signatures, especially if this analysis rellies only on known vulnerabilities and if we suspect an advanced threat actor is involved, that could engage in efforts to delete traces of their activity. It is also possible that attackers use techniques to disrupt or hinder forensic analysis efforts, on what is commonly known as anti-forensics. </p> <p>Therefore, not getting an immediate result does not mean that we can fully guarantee the device has not been targeted or compromised, both because of anti-forensic techniques as well as limitations on access to useful forensic artifacts or threat intelligence . Moreover, threat actors often move dynamically, meaning that they sometimes do not maintain persistent access to devices. Finding the footprints of a threat actor using automated analysis tools often requires access to threat intelligence (in the form of indicators of compromise) that can be used to compare against our local collection. Additional manual analysis can take place to try and identify patterns and logs of potential new exploits and vectors of compromise. The IOCs and skills necessary for the discovery of new attacks might not always be readily available, and sometimes it might be helpful to store forensic evidence for additional study and investigation further down the road. This should always be done in clear consent with the impacted person, and making sure data management and data security policies are being followed. </p> <p>During the last 5 years, different projects and funds have invigorated a global community of forensic analysts, including with a few emerging laboratories across in the global majority. This has increased local capacities, but it is still crucial that collaboration remains at the center of all these efforts. Peer-to-peer support, within regions and globally, is fundamental for the collective success, including through greater sharing of threat information as well as building of skills and knowledge. The establishment of a forensic lab is usually the first step in a process that can take several years to mature, and where collaboration is key for long-term sustainability. </p>","tags":["explainer","intro"]},{"location":"explainers/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics.html#important-considerations-when-conducting-forensic-investigations","title":"Important considerations when conducting forensic investigations","text":"<p>Below we detail a few important aspects to keep in mind when conducting forensic investigations in support of at-risk users from civil society. </p>","tags":["explainer","intro"]},{"location":"explainers/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics/01-explainer-introduction-digital-forensics.html#informed-consent","title":"Informed consent","text":"<p>Different from forensic investigations in other contexts (judicial, corporate), forensic investigations in support of Human Rights Defenders should always be consented.

However, below you\u2019ll find some common types of threat actors who civil society colleagues face: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Spyware or surveillance vendors: There is a vast network of companies that develop, broker, sell, and supply surveillance technologies, the majority of them are privately owned and generate revenue from the products and services they offer. Some lists are available including this list by the Atlantic Council or this resource by Business and Human Rights. Often, these companies, their founders, or their staff have ties to the military and intelligence sectors. For example, in the case of the infamous NSO group, one of the co-founders previously served in the military intelligence and the Mossad. Spyware companies have access to advanced technical capabilities, financial resources, legal counsel, and sometimes political power and connections. Forensic research can have an impact on the company's business and reputation, like when Cellebrite stopped operations in Serbia and other countries due to human rights concerns, or more recently when NSO received a large fine of 170 million dollars in the WhatsApp vs. NSO legal case. Moreover, the exposure of infrastructure and vulnerabilities through forensic reports often means that developers of spyware need to switch to new infrastructure and find/exploit new vulnerabilities, which creates challenges and economic impacts for their business.  </p> </li> <li> <p>State actors: Oftentimes, states, police, military or intelligence agencies act as the operators of the spyware technology, which means they control who is targeted, and when and what information is retrieved. While many governments rely on commercial or mercenary spyware, some states also develop their own technology, with varying degrees of sophistication. Forensic research by civil society can lead to the exposure of abuses and violations of law and/or human rights, and potentially lead to accountability actions, including through legal mechanisms. Thus, state actors can look to prevent, challenge, discredit or even criminalize civil society forensic investigations. </p> </li> <li> <p>Trolls and disinformation actors: Since at least 2022, as additional forensic research by civil society exposed misuse of spyware, some persistent actors have emerged to discredit findings by reputable labs using pseudoscience and disinformation. These campaigns have also resulted in harassment of researchers or organizations, and distraction from research activities. In other contexts, where social media manipulation is a common practice, networks of trolls have emerged in connection with threat notifications, to spread misinformation and dismiss the validity of such notifications.   </p> </li> <li> <p>For-profit cybersecurity companies: A few cybersecurity companies have started engaging with civil society looking for indicators of compromise or other forms of threat intelligence that can support their research and development of for-profit products. The difference in incentives, resources and goals between the private sector and civil society can lead to extractive relationships that end up harming the reputation of forensic labs, and potentially victims if their data is not managed properly.

As it is the case with any type of investigation, prior to collecting evidence it is important to discuss and document an informed consent, while also making conscious efforts to minimize personal data alongside information protection and verification practices. We have published a draft consent letter that can be adjusted as needed.  </p> <p>In the case of mobile devices, regarding investigations focusing on advanced threats, most of the analysis conducted so far by civil society (by organizations like Citizen Lab or Amnesty tech) uses log-based forensics to arrive at conclusions and extract findings. The possibility of collecting targeted information (for example, a bugreport), including in remote support situations, makes this a common and convenient method of analysis. </p> <p>Evidence collected is usually analyzed after the fact, normally in a forensic lab environment, ideally in accordance with best practices for operational security and evidence preservation. Tools like MVT on AndroidQF can aid and simplify the acquisition and analysis of evidence. Generally speaking, when conducting a log-based forensic analysis, you are looking to find coincidence with known indicators of compromise (IOC) of previous attacks; or to document anomalies that when compared with a baseline depict suspicious behaviors that coincide with adversarial activity, and that have not been previously recorded or characterized. Due to this methodological approach, log-based forensic analysis can often result in high-confidence findings. </p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that not having a match with known IOCs is not necessarily a confirmation of a \u201cclean device\u201d. It might be possible that threat actors have taken measures to prevent forensic analysis, or that the attack is exploiting a zero-day vulnerability that has not been previously detected. One of the advantages of log-based analysis is that you can store records, in case new information is discovered at a later date, potentially resulting in useful additional intelligence. If you are planning to store records for future analysis, it is important to ensure you have the necessary consent, and that you have taken measures to eliminate any personal information that is not relevant from a forensic standpoint.  </p> <p>The publication \u201cDetection and analysis of spyware: methodologies, limitations and opportunities\u201d summarizes and presents different methodologies commonly used by civil society, specifically for the detection of spyware. In addition to log-based forensics (covered as forensic analysis on the report), the text also mentions investigations based on monitoring signals, specially from agents running on systems and looking after suspicious patterns, processes or other signals; and also analysis and investigations that rely on network traffic monitoring to identify traces of suspicious activity in the network communications.   </p> <p>In summary, some of the advantages of log-based forensics include: </p> <ul> <li>Facilitates remote attention and triage </li> <li>Collects less private information, when compared to full disk copies, and specially when information is minimized.  </li> <li>It can result in high confidence results, particularly if you can match with known indicators of compromise.    </li> <li>It is useful to make comparisons when you have a known baseline to compare against.  </li> <li>It is possible to continue evaluating forensic artifacts against new indicators of compromise that are published at a later date.</li> </ul> <p>And some of the challenges of log-based forensics are:</p> <ul> <li>Even when you only do targeted extraction of artifacts, it is possible that the collected information contains thousands or tens of thousands lines, which means that manual review and analysis requires time and experience with the filtering and scanning of information.   </li> <li>Some logs and records may not be available from the user profile, or might require additional permissions (like for example, route access on android)  </li> <li>Most log files work with circular buffers that are overweight as they are filled up, therefore the older information is constantly being overwritten   </li> <li>Although some tools can facilitate the process, in general for the extraction of records and logs it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the operating system.</li> </ul>","tags":["explainer","intro"]},{"location":"explainers/03-explainer-log-forensics-android/03-explainer-log-forensics-android.html#how-do-you-initiate-a-log-based-analysis-on-an-android-device","title":"How do you initiate a log based analysis on an android device?","text":"<p>To perform a log-based forensic analysis, you need to go through the typical stages of a forensic investigation, starting with the capture of key system records from the device under investigation.

In the forensic field, this means providing enough information so that the beneficiary of support understands what actions, risks, rights and responsibilities are part of the investigation process. Informed consent is not just about signing a form, but a process led by the analyst or the forensic lab to communicate in a clear and transparent way with the beneficiary of support, and ensure their will is respected. </p> <p>One of the reasons consent is necessary is related to the fact that digital evidence might include personal information, like contacts, files, pictures, applications, etc. This can carry risks, in case the information is exposed or not managed properly, and potentially could be subject to data protection regulation (GDPR, for example).

Ensuring that consent is well informed is an ethical and legal responsibility of medicine practitioners. </p> <p>When engaging in a forensic investigation to support an individual or organization from civil society, the process of obtaining consent should clarify aspects like: </p> <ul> <li>What information is being collected? What personal data is included in the collection?    </li> <li>What will happen during the investigation?  </li> <li>With whom will this information be shared?   </li> <li>What risks can emerge from the forensic analysis?  </li> <li>What results can be expected?  </li> <li>Can the name of the individual be used in publications? Can they be mentioned anonymously?  </li> <li>For how long will the collected information be stored? </li> </ul> <p>Ideally, consent should be asked before engaging in any evidence collection. A lot of the information listed above can be discussed and clarified verbally in the initial stages of an investigation, but it is important to also consider a written consent agreement that captures key agreements. </p> <p>You should also take into account that many of the individuals asking for support are embedded in high risk contexts, going through traumatic situations. Establishing trust and engaging in active listening is key. While we do not focus on the principles of holistic response in this repository, we do recommend you consider and consult resources like the Psychological First Aid Manual from the organization Vita Activa. </p> <p>Please also keep in mind that presenting a document full of legal language and description of risks can create stress and anxiety, especially if it is not accompanied with additional context and explanation, or if trust has yet to be established. Consent is a key aspect of forensic research, and a step in conducting additional research that will lead to greater accountability, but the priority should always be the wellbeing of the Human Rights Defender. </p> <p>In the following section we present a draft of a letter of informed consent that can be adapted to the specific needs and particularities of each forensic investigation. We also provide guidance on how to adapt it and what to keep in mind when applying it.</p>","tags":["how-to","intro"]},{"location":"how-tos/01-how-to-obtain-informed-consent/01-how-to-obtain-informed-consent.html#documenting-informed-consent","title":"Documenting informed consent","text":"<p>In order to create an informed consent document, aside from engaging in direct conversations with the requester of assistance, follow these steps: </p> <p>1- Download the informed consent letter draft template.
