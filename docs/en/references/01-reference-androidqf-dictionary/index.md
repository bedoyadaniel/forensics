# AndroidQF output file dictionary

This document is part of a **technical documentation repository** whose main objective is to establish a baseline of proven, flexible and accessible knowledge to **boost consensual forensic analysis in support of civil society across the globe**. To organize the contents, we use the [technical documentation framework Diátaxis](../00-glossary/index.md#diataxis). 

This particular resource fits within [the reference category in Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/reference/), and contains information about files generated by the tool [androidqf](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf) when conducting a forensic extraction of an Android device. The objective is to **facilitate the understanding of the resulting files, including what information is included and why it could be helpful from a forensic standpoint**. 
This particular resource falls under the [references](https://diataxis.fr/reference) category, and contains information about the files generated by [androidqf](../.../references/00-glossary/index.md#androidqf) when performing a forensic extraction of an Android device, so that an analyst person **knows what files are generated, how to use them, where to look for specific information and in what format to find it.** Additionally, the equivalent ADB commands for each module are included to show the queries that AndroidQF performs internally and how it can be replicated manually. In cases where the output of the ADB command differs from the file generated by AndroidQF, an example of the actual output of the command is also added to show these differences and facilitate its interpretation.

This resource was last updated on November 26, 2025 and the [commit e6bbc564bf9d1edfb18886f4b58c05dcf5b23c9c](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/commit/e6bbc564bf9d1edfb18886f4b58c05dcf5b23c9c) was used as the basis for compiling the information. This resource was originally developed in Spanish, and translated with the support of Marianne Parrott. 

[Androidqf](../00-glossary/index.md#androidqf) is a forensic extraction tool, part of the [Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) project](../00-glossary/index.md#mvt). It is maintained by  [Amnesty International Security Lab.](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/)   

The name of the tool emerges from Android Quick Forensics. It is a **[portable tool](../00-glossary/index.md#portable-tool)**, which means it can be executed on Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS with a precompiled binary, without requiring an installation. This simplifies the acquisition of key forensic information from Android devices, specially in remote scenarios. 

The information generated by androidqf can be **grouped into 5 main categories**: 

* Acquisition and extraction  
* Device information and configuration  
* System logs and events  
* Processes and applications  
* Information backed up from the device 

## Acquisition and extraction

### acquisition.json

The information in this file is generated by the [acquisition.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format and records information related to the data acquisition process of the device. It contains the following details: 

* UUID of the extraction, which is also used as the name of the folder where the information is stored.  
* Version of androidqf.  
* Location where the extraction is stored.  
* Date and time of start and end of the acquisition.  
* Information of the collector binary used.  
* Information of the ADB binary used.  
* Location of the SD card storage.  
* CPU architecture of the device. 

**Why is this important?**

This file provides general information about the extraction and the device, including unique identifiers that can be helpful to ensure the chain of custody of the forensic evidence. 

**Example:**

```
{
 "uuid": "0f615832-ed22-411e-9317-b429d28ecf9a",
 "androidqf_version": "v1.7.0-1-gf7642bf",

  },
  "Architecture": "arm64-v8a"
 },
 "tmp_dir": "/data/local/tmp/",
 "sdcard": "/sdcard/",
 "cpu": "arm64-v8a"
}
```

### command.log

The information in this file is generated by the [logger.go](http://logger.go). This module presents detailed logs of the acquisition process of the device. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in plain text with a .log extension and contains a record of the commands executed during data acquisition. It documents each command used (DEBUG) and its output on screen (INFO), warning messages (WARNING) and error messages (ERROR) during execution. It uses the following structure: 

* Date and time of the command or message  
* Type of message  
* Content of the message

**Why is this important?**

This file presents a log of the actions performed by the app during the data acquisition process. This allows the analyst to verify the completeness of the extraction, to ensure all steps were performed. In case of errors, it also provides information to debug and fix potential issues. 

**Example:**

```

### hashes.csv

The information in this file is generated by the [*HashFiles*](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go#L134) function of the [acquisition.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) format and stores the [SHA-256](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)  hashes for each file generated during extraction or extracted from the device. It uses the following format: 

* File name and location  
* Hash value using SHA-256

**Why is this important?** 

The hashes help to guarantee the integrity of the information and ensure that it has not been modified after acquisition, facilitating independent verification and chain of custody.

## Device information and configuration

### getprop.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [getprop.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/getprop.go) module. 

This file is in *txt* format and contains information about device properties such as Android version, build number, serial number, network settings, manufacturer, USB debugging status, software and hardware related values.
**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb getprop` command, which details the **system properties**.

System properties are key-value pairs of strings that are stored in the global [*build.prop*](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-build-prop-wiki.2056266/) dictionary or in *.sysprop* files, and provide a convenient way to share information, usually settings, throughout the system.

The information can be found in the following format:

```
[{prefix}.]{group}[.{subgroup}]*.{name}[.{type}]
```

The prefix *ro* is used for read-only configurations, or settings that have been set after the last reboot. The prefix prefix *persist* is used for configurations that are persistent after a reboot. It is also possible that properties do not have a prefix, meaning they begin directly with the group they belong to. 

The most common groups are:

* *bluetooth*, Bluetooth related  
* *boot*, sysprops from kernel cmdline  
* *build*, sysprops that identify a build  
* *telephony*, telephony related  
* *audio*, audio related  
* *graphics*, graphics related  
* *vold*, vold related 

For more details, see the [list of properties already defined in the Android source code](https://oneamnesty-my.sharepoint.com/personal/marianne_parrott_amnesty_org/Documents/Downloads/lista%20de%20propiedades%20ya%20definidas%20en%20el%20c%C3%B3digo%20fuente%20de%20Android).

The equivalent ADB command in this module is as follows:

```
adb shell getprop
```

**Why is this important?**

The properties provide important information about the device's hardware and software, which can be altered by malicious software to hide its presence or to inadvertently modify the device's behaviour.

**Example:**

### env.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [env.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/env.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *txt* format and contains information about the configuration of the terminal environment variables (shell) [*mkshrc*](http://mirbsd.de/mksh) which is used by Android.


By default, the *mkshrc* variables in Android are found in the *mkshrc* or *profile* file which can be in one of the following directories.

```
/system/etc
/system/etc/profile
$HOME/
/data/local
```

The [*mkshrc* binary can be found in one of the following directories](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/refs/heads/master/libc/include/paths.h#50).

```
/product/bin
/apex/com.android.runtime/bin
/apex/com.android.art/bin
/system_ext/bin
/system/bin
/system/xbin
/odm/bin
/vendor/bin
/vendor/xbin
```

The variables contained in the file may indicate:

* Partition locations  
* Android virtual machine runtime environment values  
* Shell settings

The ADB equivalent command of this module is as follows:

```
adb shell env
```

**Why is this important?**

Environment variables may indicate changes in the settings of the terminal, the command shell, the Android virtual machine runtime environment or the mount points of some partitions and folders. This could indicate suspicious behaviour on the device for the execution of malicious software.

### mounts.json

The information in this file is generated by the [mounts.go] module (https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/mounts.go).

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *json* format and contains information about the partitions and file system directories mounted on a device in the user space and in the Android linux kernel.

The ADB equivalent command of this module is as follows:

```
adb shell "mount"
adb shell "cat /proc/mounts"
```

The *mount* command reads information directly from the kernel, which reflects a list of mounted file systems on the device. On the other hand, the *cat /proc/mounts* command directly accesses the */proc/mounts* file, which is a virtual file generated and managed by the Android linux kernel. This file accurately reflects in real time the exact state of all file systems mounted on the device, including partitions, logical volumes and temporary file systems.

The format in which the mount points are presented is as follows:

```
<device> <mount-point> <type> <options>
```

Where each parameter means the following:

* **device**: Partition or mounted volume, in Android the most common ones are:
    * Physical storage partitions
        /dev/block/sdX: Physical storage device ([eMMC/UFS](https://new.c.mi.com/es/post/11738)) exposed as sd by the kernel.
        /dev/block/mmcblk: eMMC storage device presented as mmcblk.
        /dev/block/dm-X: Device managed by device-mapper (encrypted, verity or logical partitions).

    /sys: Virtual system that exposes information about devices and kernel drivers.
    /mnt/user/0/emulated: Specific view of the emulated storage for user 0.
* **file system type**: File system type, in android are as follows:
    * ext4: Linux file system used on internal partitions.
    * f2fs: File system optimized for flash storage.
    * erofs: Optimized read-only file system.
    * vfat: FAT32 file system used for SD cards and external storage.
    * sdfat: Extended implementation of FAT/exFAT.

    * Users related to assemblies
        * uid=0: Owner of the assembly, who is the *root* user.
        * gid=1000: Android base group which is usually *system* or *media_rw*, depending on context.
        * user\_id=0: Main user of the Android system.
        * group\_id=0: Primary group of the root user.


**Why is this important?**

The mount points allow you to identify the storage areas mounted on the device, their origin and how they are configured.

With this information it is possible to know the permissions with which the partitions were mounted, the associated users and in some cases the SELinux security labels applied.

This is useful for identifying mounts that may be suspicious of malicious activity on the device, for example, a system partition such as /system, /vendor, /product partitions whose mount is usually read-only is mounted with write permissions or lacking security labels or a partition such as /data is mounted with read permissions on subfolders containing application information could indicate unauthorized fraudulent mounts evidencing highly suspicious behavior.

## System logs and events

### logcat.txt and logcat\_old.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [logcat.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/logcat.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

These files are in plain text with .*txt* extension and contain the system message log on two levels: current logs of all buffers (logcat.txt) and logs prior to the last reboot (logcat_old.txt).

Some examples of the information contained are:

* Error and warning messages (FATAL EXCEPTION).  
* Messages from operating system apps, processes and services.  
* Debug logs and informational events.

The file contains the following structure:

* Start of record (contains record divisions).  
* Timestamp (timestamp).  
* Process and thread identifier (PID) and (TID).  
* Priority level:  
    * E: Error  
    * W: Warning  
    * I: Information  
    * D: Debugging  
    * F: Fatal  
    * V: Verbose  
* Label indicating the system component or process.  
* Description and details of messages or errors.

The ADB equivalent command of this module is as follows:

```
#Equivalent command for the current logs
adb shell logcat -d -b all "*:V"
#Equivalent command for previous logs
adb shell logcat -L -b all "*:V"
```

**Why is this important?**

This information can be used to analyze the behavior and execution of events in the system and apps on the device to identify anomalies or patterns that may indicate the presence of malware. In forensic terms, they are among the most relevant files in terms of content.

### apks/

The information in this folder is generated by the [packages.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/packages.go) module.

**What is included in this file?**

This directory contains the APKs extracted from the device. These are the files used for the installation of apps that were present in the system upon conducting the analysis. 

The ADB equivalent command of this module is as follows:

```
adb pull <path_apk> <path_local>
```

**Why is this important?**

The analysis of the APKs installed on the device can lead to potential malicious software either embedded in existing apps or masking itself as a different application. The information in this folder also helps in doing more in-depth review of [APKs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apk_\(file_format\)), including verifying their authenticity and potentially engaging in reverse engineering to gather further intelligence and indicators of compromise. 

Example of content returned by executing ADB command to download APKs:

```
$ adb pull
/system/system_ext/priv-app/QuickAccessWallet/QuickAccessWallet.apk
/system/system_ext/priv-app/priv-app/QuickAccessWallet... 0 skipped. 8.6 MB/s (745270 bytes in 0.083s)
```


### processes.txt 

The information in this file is generated by the [processes.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/processes.go) module. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *json* format and contains detailed information about running processes.

This file presents the information in a structured form in the following order: identifiers, execution details, resource consumption and process status.

The ADB equivalent command of this module is as follows:

```
adb shell ps -A
```

**Why is this important?**

This file provides additional information about the processes that are executed in the device. Information about processes is sometimes available as part of IOC of certain malicious activities, and it is also helpful to analyze apps and processes in depth, understanding relationships between them (by exploring parent processes), among other characteristics.

### services.txt

The information on this file is generated by the [services.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/services.go) module. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *txt* format and contains detailed information about the running services.

The structure of the file is the name of the service and the process or package that is running for that service.

The ADB equivalent command for this module is as follows:

```
adb shell service list
```

**Why is this important?**

This file can help identify suspicious services, or similarly detect if some other expected services have been halted and are not running. This is useful to identify that all necessary services are running to maintain the security integrity of the device. 

**Example:** 

```

### root\_binaries.json

The information on this file is generated by the [root\_binaries.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/root_binaries.go) module, and is intended to provide guidance on whether the device is running with root privileges or not. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *json* format and contains a list of binaries to know if they are present in the system.

The binaries to which it applies are used to gain root access or elevate privileges on the device.

The list of binaries and files is:

* su
* busybox
* supersu
* Superuser.apk
* KingoUser.apk
* SuperSu.apk
* magisk
* magiskhide
* magiskinit
* magiskpolicy

If none of these files are present on the device then the contents of the file will be empty.

The equivalent ADB commands for this module are as follows:

```
adb shell "which -a su"
adb shell "which -a busybox" adb shell "which -a busybox" adb shell "which -a supersu"
adb shell "which -a supersu" adb shell "which -a supersu" adb shell "which -a Superuser.apk"
adb shell "which -a Superuser.apk" adb shell "which -a Superuser.apk" adb shell "which -a KingoUser.apk"
adb shell "which -a KingoUser.apk" adb shell "which -a KingoUser.apk" adb shell "which -a Superuser.apk"
adb shell "which -a SuperSu.apk" adb shell "which -a SuperSu.apk" adb shell "which -a SuperSu.apk"
adb shell "which -a magisk" adb shell "which -a magisk" adb shell "which -a magisk
adb shell "which -a magiskhide" adb shell "which -a magiskhide" adb shell "which -a magiskhide.apk
adb shell "which -a magiskinit" adb shell "which -a magiskinit" adb shell "which -a magiskhide
adb shell "which -a magiskpolicy" adb shell "which -a magiskpolicy"
```

**Why is this important?**

This file can help detect tools used to obtain root access on the device. This might be an indication of unauthorized access or an escalation of privileges. It might also be an indication that the phone was rooted by the owner. The command provides also a list of the binaries found, which can be helpful to understand how it was rooted. 

**Example:** 

In case the device is not rooted, the output will be something like: 

```
[]
```

When the module identifies rooting-related binaries in the standard system paths on the device, it will contain a list of these paths to the detected binaries.

Example of content returned by running AndroidQF and ADB command:


```
[
	"/system/xbin/su",
	"/system/bin/su",
	"/data/local/xbin/su",
	"/data/local/bin/busybox",
	"/sbin/su",
	"/su/bin/magisk",
	"/system/bin/.ext/.su",
	"/data/local/tmp/Superuser.apk",
	"/data/local/tmp/magiskhide".
]
```

## Information about files on the device


### backup.ab

The information in this file is generated by the [backup.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/backup.go) module.

This module is specifically designed for backing up data that is stored on Android mobile devices.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in binary format and contains data related to backing up applications and device settings. The binary data in this file is compressed and includes sensitive device information.

Depending on the option selected in androidqf the content of the file can be only the SMS or it can be a copy of data from those applications that have declared in their manifest the possibility of making copies. It is worth noting that this function is rarely used nowadays, so it does not represent a reliable backup of the device.

This compressed file can be analyzed by the MVT using the command `mvt-android check-backup backup.ab`.

The equivalent ADB commands for this module are as follows:
SMS-only equivalent command:

```
adb backup com.Android.providers.telephony
```

Equivalent command for full backup:

```
adb backup -all
```

**Why is this important?**

This information allows to generate a backup copy of the device, which helps to keep relevant evidence such as SMS or system configurations. It also facilitates the preservation of information potentially related to security incidents or phishing attacks in an integral manner with possibilities to be used for further analysis.

**Example:** 

Example of content returned by running AndroidQF:

### files.json

The information on this file is generated using the [files.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/files.go) module. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *json* format and generates a record of files and metadata in the following paths:

* /sdcard/  
* /system/  
* /system\_ext/  
* /vendor/  
* /cust/  
* /product/  
* /apex/  
* /data/local/tmp/
