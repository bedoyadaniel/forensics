# AndroidQF output file dictionary

This document is part of a **technical documentation repository** whose main objective is to establish a baseline of proven, flexible and accessible knowledge to **boost consensual forensic analysis in support of civil society across the globe**. To organize the contents, we use the [technical documentation framework Diátaxis](../00-glossary/index.md#diataxis). 

This particular resource fits within [the reference category in Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/reference/), and contains information about files generated by the tool [androidqf](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf) when conducting a forensic extraction of an Android device. The objective is to **facilitate the understanding of the resulting files, including what information is included and why it could be helpful from a forensic standpoint**. 
This particular resource falls under the [references](https://diataxis.fr/reference) category, and contains information about the files generated by [androidqf](../.../references/00-glossary/index.md#androidqf) when performing a forensic extraction of an Android device, so that an analyst person **knows what files are generated, how to use them, where to look for specific information and in what format to find it.** Additionally, the equivalent ADB commands for each module are included to show the queries that AndroidQF performs internally and how it can be replicated manually. In cases where the output of the ADB command differs from the file generated by AndroidQF, an example of the actual output of the command is also added to show these differences and facilitate its interpretation.

This resource was last updated on November 26, 2025 and the [commit e6bbc564bf9d1edfb18886f4b58c05dcf5b23c9c](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/commit/e6bbc564bf9d1edfb18886f4b58c05dcf5b23c9c) was used as the basis for compiling the information.
This resource was last updated on June 16, 2025, and for the presentation of the information we based our [version 1.7.1](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/tree/v1.7.1). This resource was originally developed in Spanish, and translated with the support of Marianne Parrott. 

[Androidqf](../00-glossary/index.md#androidqf) is a forensic extraction tool, part of the [Mobile Verification Toolkit (MVT) project](../00-glossary/index.md#mvt). It is maintained by  [Amnesty International Security Lab.](https://securitylab.amnesty.org/)   

The name of the tool emerges from Android Quick Forensics. It is a **[portable tool](../00-glossary/index.md#portable-tool)**, which means it can be executed on Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS with a precompiled binary, without requiring an installation. This simplifies the acquisition of key forensic information from Android devices, specially in remote scenarios. 

The information generated by androidqf can be **grouped into 5 main categories**: 

* Acquisition and extraction  
* Device information and configuration  
* System logs and events  
* Processes and applications  
* Information backed up from the device 

## Acquisition and extraction

### acquisition.json

The information in this file is generated by the [acquisition.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/acquisition/acquisition.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format and records information related to the data acquisition process of the device. It contains the following details: 

* UUID of the extraction, which is also used as the name of the folder where the information is stored.  
* Version of androidqf.  
* Location where the extraction is stored.  
* Date and time of start and end of the acquisition.  
* Information of the collector binary used.  
* Information of the ADB binary used.  
* Location of the SD card storage.  
* CPU architecture of the device. 

**Why is this important?**

This file provides general information about the extraction and the device, including unique identifiers that can be helpful to ensure the chain of custody of the forensic evidence. 

**Example:**

```
{
 "uuid": "0f615832-ed22-411e-9317-b429d28ecf9a",
 "androidqf_version": "v1.7.0-1-gf7642bf",

  },
  "Architecture": "arm64-v8a"
 },
 "tmp_dir": "/data/local/tmp/",
 "sdcard": "/sdcard/",
 "cpu": "arm64-v8a"
}
```

### command.log

The information in this file is generated by the [logger.go](http://logger.go). This module presents detailed logs of the acquisition process of the device. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in plain text with a .log extension and contains a record of the commands executed during data acquisition. It documents each command used (DEBUG) and its output on screen (INFO), warning messages (WARNING) and error messages (ERROR) during execution. It uses the following structure: 

* Date and time of the command or message  
* Type of message  
* Content of the message

**Why is this important?**

This file presents a log of the actions performed by the app during the data acquisition process. This allows the analyst to verify the completeness of the extraction, to ensure all steps were performed. In case of errors, it also provides information to debug and fix potential issues. 

**Example:**

```

## Device information and configuration

### getprop.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [getprop.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/getprop.go) module. 

This file is in *txt* format and contains information about device properties such as Android version, build number, serial number, network settings, manufacturer, USB debugging status, software and hardware related values.
**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb getprop` command, which details the **system properties**.

System properties are key-value pairs of strings that are stored in the global [*build.prop*](https://xdaforums.com/t/guide-build-prop-wiki.2056266/) dictionary or in *.sysprop* files, and provide a convenient way to share information, usually settings, throughout the system.

The information can be found in the following format:

```
[{prefix}.]{group}[.{subgroup}]*.{name}[.{type}]
```

The prefix *ro* is used for read-only configurations, or settings that have been set after the last reboot. The prefix prefix *persist* is used for configurations that are persistent after a reboot. It is also possible that properties do not have a prefix, meaning they begin directly with the group they belong to. 

The most common groups are:

* *bluetooth*, Bluetooth related  
* *boot*, sysprops from kernel cmdline  
* *build*, sysprops that identify a build  
* *telephony*, telephony related  
* *audio*, audio related  
* *graphics*, graphics related  
* *vold*, vold related 
The equivalent ADB command in this module is as follows:

For more details, see the [list of properties already defined in the Android source code](https://oneamnesty-my.sharepoint.com/personal/marianne_parrott_amnesty_org/Documents/Downloads/lista%20de%20propiedades%20ya%20definidas%20en%20el%20c%C3%B3digo%20fuente%20de%20Android).
adb shell getprop

**Why is this important?**

The properties provide important information about the device's hardware and software, which can be altered by malicious software to hide its presence or to inadvertently modify the device's behaviour.

### selinux.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [selinux.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/selinux.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell getenforce` command. It indicates the *SELinux* security policy applied on the device, indicating the mode that it is in (*enforcing*, *permissive*, or *disabled*).

**Why is this important?**

[*SELinux*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux) is a key security layer in Android. Changes to its configuration can be an indication of compromises to the security of the device.

**Example:**
This file is in *txt* format and contains information about the security policy *SELinux* security policy applied on the device, indicating the mode it is in (*enforcing*, *permissive*, or *disabled*).

### settings\_global.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [settings.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/settings.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell cmd settings list global` command, which shows preferences that always apply identically to all defined users ([well-defined user](https://source.android.com/docs/devices/admin/multi-user#user_types)). Apps can read them, but cannot write them. These are preferences that the user must explicitly modify via the system user interface or APIs specialized in these values.

These settings include development settings, boot count, and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and telephony connection status. For the [complete list of global preferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Global), please refer to the relevant Android documentation.

**Why is this important?**

It allows the identification of anomalous settings that could compromise the security, privacy or functionality of the device. Unusual default settings may signal intentional or accidental attempts to modify system behaviour.

**Example:**

### env.txt

The information in this file is generated by the [env.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/env.go) module.

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in TXT format and contains the output of the `adb shell env` command, which shows the configuration of the [*mkshrc*](http://mirbsd.de/mksh) (shell) environment variables used by Android.

By default, the *mkshrc* variables in Android are found in the *mkshrc* or *profile* file which can be in one of the following directories.

```
/system/etc
/system/etc/profile
$HOME/
/data/local
```

The [*mkshrc* binary can be found in one of the following directories](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/refs/heads/master/libc/include/paths.h#50).

```
/product/bin
/apex/com.android.runtime/bin
/apex/com.android.art/bin
/system_ext/bin
This file is in *txt* format and contains information about the configuration of the terminal environment variables (shell) [*mkshrc*](http://mirbsd.de/mksh) which is used by Android.
/system/bin
/system/xbin

/vendor/bin
/vendor/xbin
```

The variables contained in the file may indicate:

* Partition locations  
* Android virtual machine runtime environment values  
* Shell settings

**Why is this important?**

Environment variables may indicate changes in the settings of the terminal, the command shell, the Android virtual machine runtime environment or the mount points of some partitions and folders. This could indicate suspicious behaviour on the device for the execution of malicious software.

### mounts.json

The information in this file is generated by the [mounts.go] module (https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/mounts.go).
**Why is this important?**
**Information contained

This information can be used to analyze the behavior and execution of events in the system and apps on the device to identify anomalies or patterns that may indicate the presence of malware. In forensic terms, they are among the most relevant files in terms of content.
This file is in *json* format and contains information about the partitions and file system directories mounted on a device in user space and the Android linux kernel.

The ADB equivalent command of this module is as follows:
**Example:**

adb shell "mount"
adb shell "cat /proc/mounts".
```
--------- beginning of crash  
The *mount* command reads information directly from the kernel, which reflects a list of the file systems mounted on the device. The *cat /proc/mounts* command directly accesses the */proc/mounts* file, which is a virtual file generated and managed by the Android linux kernel. This file accurately reflects in real time the exact state of all file systems mounted on the device, including partitions, logical volumes and temporary file systems.

**Why is it important?

The mount points allow you to identify the storage areas mounted on the device, their origin and how they are configured.
* [Logcat command-line tool  |  Android Studio  |  Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat)
With this information it is possible to know the permissions with which the partitions were mounted, the associated users and in some cases the SELinux security labels applied.

This is useful for identifying mounts that may be suspicious of malicious activity on the device, for example, a system partition such as /system, /vendor, /product partitions whose mount is usually read-only is mounted with write permissions or lacking security labels or a partition such as /data is mounted with read permissions on subfolders containing application information could indicate unauthorized fraudulent mounts evidencing highly suspicious behavior.

[Dumpsys](https://developer.android.com/tools/dumpsys) is a powerful ADB tool, and in addition to what is collected through androidqf, there are additional options to be used to further explore the network services, battery, and input diagnostics. 

 

**Why is this important?**

This file provides  information about the services running on a device and the flags and logs they generate. This is useful from a forensic standpoint since it can help identify known services or processes that are suspicious. 
These files are in plain text with extension .*txt* and contain the system message log on two levels: current logs of all buffers (logcat.txt) and logs prior to the last reboot (logcat_old.txt).

Some examples of the information contained are:
**Example:**

```
Currently running services:
  accessibility
  account
  adb
  alarm
  android.frameworks.cameraservice.service.ICameraService/default
  android.hardware.biometrics.face.IFace/default
  android.hardware.vibrator.IVibratorManager/default
  android.os.UpdateEngineService
  android.security.authorization
  anrmanager
  anti_root_dialog
  app_binding
  appops

### root\_binaries.json

The information on this file is generated by the [root\_binaries.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/root_binaries.go) module, and is intended to provide guidance on whether the device is running with root privileges or not. 

**What is included in this file?** 

This file is in *json* format and contains the output of the command `adb shell which -a` applied to a list of binaries to determine whether they are present on the system or not. 

The binaries included are commonly used to obtain root access, or to elevate privileges in the system. The list of binaries that is checked using this command is the following: 

* su  
* busybox  
* supersu  
When the module identifies rooting-related binaries in the standard system paths on the device, it will contain a list of these paths to the detected binaries.
* Superuser.apk  
Example of content returned by running AndroidQF and ADB command:
* KingoUser.apk  
* SuperSu.apk  
* magisk  
* magiskhide  
* magiskinit  
* magiskpolicy

If none of these files is present in the system, then the content of the file will be empty. 

**Why is this important?**

This file can help detect tools used to obtain root access on the device. This might be an indication of unauthorized access or an escalation of privileges. It might also be an indication that the phone was rooted by the owner. The command provides also a list of the binaries found, which can be helpful to understand how it was rooted. 

**Example:** 

In case the device is not rooted, the output will be something like: 

```
[]
```

In case the device is rooted, the command will provide a list of the binaries found: 

```
[
	"/system/xbin/su",
This file is in binary format and contains data related to the backup of applications and device settings. The binary data in this file is compressed and includes sensitive device information.
	"/system/bin/su",
Depending on the option selected in androidqf the content of the file can be only SMS or it can be a copy of data from those applications that have declared in their manifest the possibility of making copies. It is worth noting that this feature is rarely used nowadays, so it does not represent a reliable backup of the device.
	"/data/local/xbin/su",
	"/data/local/bin/busybox",
	"/sbin/su",
The equivalent ADB commands for this module are as follows:
Equivalent command for SMS only:
	"/su/bin/magisk",
	"/system/bin/.ext/.su",
adb backup com.Android.providers.telephony
	"/data/local/tmp/Superuser.apk",
	"/data/local/tmp/magiskhide"
Equivalent command for full backup:
]

adb backup -all

```

## Information backed up from the device

This information allows to generate a backup copy of the device, which helps to keep relevant evidence such as SMS or system configurations. It also facilitates the preservation of information potentially related to security incidents or phishing attacks in an integral manner with possibilities to be used for further analysis.
### backup.ab

The information on this file is generated by the [backup.go](https://github.com/mvt-project/androidqf/blob/main/modules/backup.go) module. This module is specifically designed to create security copies of data stored on Android devices. 
Example of content returned by AndroidQF execution:

**What is included in this file?** 

This is a binary file, and contains data extracted using the command `adb backup` using parameters depending on the options selected from: “only SMS”, “everything” or “no backup”. These binary files might contain personal information. 

The resulting file can be analyzed using [MVT](https://github.com/mvt-project/mvt) through the command `mvt-android check-backup backup.ab`

**Why is this important?**

When SMS backup is allowed, the information from the SMS messages can be used to locate potential malicious links or other indicators of compromise. 

**Example:**
